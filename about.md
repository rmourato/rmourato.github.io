Hello, reader!

I'm Rui Mourato and this is my professional blog. The name is Portuguese, so if "Rui" twists your tongue
then "*Rooee*" is a good approximation if you were to pronounce it in English.

I do software for a living and that's my passion, if this wasn't the case I wouldn't be doing it (I get bored easily).

When I'm not doing software I'm probably reading on how get better at it, playing the piano (something I've only recently started, so please cover your ears)
or simply spending time with my family in Scotland.

# Contacting me

Whether you would like to have a chat, comment on my posts or like the opportunity to work 
together (I'm currently working as an independent developer so I'd be delighted to) then you can 
e-mail me at: 

<rui.mourato@gmail.com>

Alternatively you can follow me on Twitter @ruimourato or find me on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.theme.linkedin }}).
