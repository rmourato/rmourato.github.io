Hello, reader!

I'm Rui Mourato and this is my professional blog. The name is Portuguese, so if "Rui" twists your tongue
then "*Rooee*" is a good approximation if you were to pronounce it in English.

I do software for a living and that's my passion, if it weren't I wouldn't be doing it (I get bored easily)!

When I'm not doing software I'm probably reading on how get better at it, playing the piano (something I've only recently started, so please cover your ears)
or simply spending time with my family in Scotland.

# Contacting me

Whether you would simply like to have a chat, comment on my posts or would like the opportunity to work

e-mail me at:
