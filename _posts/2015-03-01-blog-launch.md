I've finally got round to get my own blog up and running.

It's content will be largely technical, so expect the focus of my posts
to be centered around software techniques, methodologies and other 
adventures using whatever technology is appropriate to get the job done.

I hope what I share will be of use to you and you stay around.

And why not help me find better solutions, too? Feel free to 
comment and I will do my best to come back to you and revise my entries.
